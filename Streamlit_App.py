        This app offers the following regression models to predict delivery times:

        - **Gradient Boosting Regressor**: An ensemble learning method that builds a model in stages, where each stage corrects the errors of the previous one. It generally works well for complex data.
        
        - **Random Forest Regressor**: Another ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and averages their predictions. It is robust to overfitting and works well with large datasets.
        
        - **Linear Regression**: A simple, interpretable model that assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the output. It's fast and easy to understand but may underperform on complex data.

        - **XGBoost Regressor**: A scalable and accurate implementation of gradient boosting that offers regularization to reduce overfitting and high performance with large datasets.

        Below are some performance metrics commonly used to evaluate regression models:

        - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
        - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
        - **R-squared (R¬≤)**

        This project is part of an Amazon Delivery Time Prediction initiative. The aim of the project is 
        to accurately predict delivery times for packages based on several features such as:
        
        - Store Location (Latitude and Longitude)
        - Delivery Address (Latitude and Longitude)
        - Agent Rating
        - Time of Order Placement
        
        The model was trained on a dataset with real-world delivery information and was evaluated based on 
        several performance metrics.
        
        **Technologies Used:**
        - Python, Streamlit
        - Machine Learning (Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Linear Regression, XGBoost)
        - Geospatial Data Analysis (Geopy)
        - Model Serving (Joblib)
